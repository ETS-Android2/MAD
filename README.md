<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->
<p>
In a situation where the whole world is facing a pandemic, the main topic around the world now is about Health-related areas. But there are so much of areas that we don’t talk about these days. That is the people who lost their mode of income. When we consider about this category, the businesses related to tourism are highlighted. So, after having a discussion among the group members, we thought of building an app related to hotel and tourism area. A common problem that some customers and hotels face is that satisfying the needs and wants of their customers to the utmost level. Due to this problem sometimes, the customers may leave those respective hotels with less satisfaction, and it will affect the hotel owners in an immense manner. So, as a solution for this problem we came across an app called “SATHKAARAYA”.  
</p><p>
SATHKAARAYA is an android mobile app developed to ease the tasks of a hotel management. This app is a guest service app which lets the customers to receive any of the services provided by the respective hotels by their own mobile phone. So, when a customer boards into a certain hotel who is having this app must register to this app by providing their personal details. Then an account is created for that customer.  
For a customer who had been registered already he/she can log in to the app by providing his/her log in credentials. After doing that a customer can get the services from this app.   
</p><p>
A customer who is using this app can order any food according to their wish. Only thing he must do is to click on a button and place the order using a form. Then the request is handled by the system and passed on to the relevant admin. Also, a customer can reserve services provided by the hotel gymnasium. Also, the customer can book the gym time slots that is needed by the guests using the Gym and activities which is also connected to this services app. As one of the other services provided by this app, we can mention the Travelling service. In this scenario a customer can book a certain travel package according to their desire in the period that they are boarded in. Customer is asked for his/her requirements via a form and the rest is handled using the system. Finally, a customer can get the total amount that needs to be paid in his/her account. So, these are some of the services provided by the “SATHKAARAYA” guest services app to a customer.
